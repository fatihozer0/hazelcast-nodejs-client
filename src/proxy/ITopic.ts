 * (pub/sub) messaging model. Publish and subscriptions are cluster-wide.
 *
 * This interface stand for topic and reliable topic. Reliable Topic uses a Ringbuffer to store
 * events. The events in the Ringbuffer are replicated, so they won't get
 * lost when a node goes down.
 *
 * Methods that require serialization/deserialization may throw RangeError, e.g when there is no suitable
 * serializer for a certain type. Also they may throw {@link HazelcastSerializationError} if a compact
 * object is cannot be deserialized due to unknown schema.
